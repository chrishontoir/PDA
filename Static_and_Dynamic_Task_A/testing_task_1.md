# Line 14 - should be '==' instead of '='.
# Line 21 - should be 'def' instead of 'dif'.
# Line 21 - parameters 'card1' and 'card2' should be separated by a comma.
# Line 23 - 'card' is not defined, should either be 'card1' or 'card2'.
# Line 23 - '.name' is undefined, should be '.suit' or '.value'.
# Line 25 - should say 'return card2.value'.
# Line 28 - end is in the wrong place, it should be at the end of the document, after line 36.
# Line 31 - a variable must be assigned before it is used. Should probably say 'total = 0'.
# Line 34 - the return should be outside the for loop, after the 'end' on line 35.
